# Pathfinding Race

Pathfinding Race is a web application that visualizes A*, Dijkstra's, and BFS pathfinding algorithms in real-time on a grid.

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualization:** Compare A*, Dijkstra's, and BFS.
- **Interactive Grid:** Set start/end points and add obstacles.
- **Easy Setup:** Clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Set Start and End Points:** Click cells to set green (start) and red (end) points.
2. **Add Obstacles:** Click cells to add obstacles for algorithms to navigate.
3. **Select Algorithm:** Choose A*, Dijkstra's, or BFS from the dropdown.
4. **Visualize Pathfinding:** Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm find the shortest path.
5. **Reset Grid:** Use the "Reset" button to clear the grid.
